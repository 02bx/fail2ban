ToDo                                         $Revision$
=============================================================

Legend:
- not yet done
? maybe
# partially done
* done

- Improve communication. (asyncore, asynchat??)

- Improve execution of action. Why does subprocess.call
  deadlock with multi-jails?

- Verify TAI64N

- signal handling (ctrl-c, etc)

# see Feature Request Tracking System at SourceForge.net

- improve installation process (better prefix support)

# improve documentation and website for user

- use PyLint to check the code

# better return values in function

? add gettext support. Is this really needed for a server
  utility?

# add a test framework. We could use unittest which is in
  Python since 2.1. It should be possible to run all tests
  automatically.

? restart automatically the daemon if an exception occurs.

- do not close socket after a send

# refactoring in server.py, actions.py, filter.py
